### Create a password scrambler

Your pbjective is to create a simple password scrambler using HTML, JavaScript, and possibly some light CSS.

Your application should accept a seed or suggestion word from the user, transform the seed, and display the scrambled password to the user.

You should produce a HTML file, and link to a separate JavaScript file to store the apps functionality.

Consider common password requirements, like:

- Character length.
- Charcter combination requirements (must have upper and lower case, numbers, and special characters.

Some options to scramble the seed password are:

- Swapping similar looking characters: @ for a, 1 for l, o for 0.
- Filling minimum length with random characters.
- Performing letter shifts: a for b, d for e, x for y, z for a.
